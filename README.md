# Pedestrain_Prediction

Classification Task

The project predicts if the pedestrain would be affected in a road accident or not.

It runs many machine learning algorithms on road accident dataset taken from http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/pages/fatalities 
Scikit learn and Weka are used to run the models - Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Rule based algorithms. 

The code produces classification report with Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score and averages.
